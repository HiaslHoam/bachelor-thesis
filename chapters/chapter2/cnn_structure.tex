Amongst different neural network architectures, CNNs proved to be very successful in image recognition. The \textit{ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge} (ILSVRC) is a competition for algorithms to classify images from the ImageNet catalogue and was held between 2010 and 2017. Since 2012, every winning neural network was a convolutional neural network, jumping from a 28\% top-5 error in 2010 to a 2.3\% error in 2017. Two main improvements are responsible for this rapid increase in accuracy:\\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Usage of GPUs for training
    \item Development of deeper convolutional neural networks
\end{enumerate}

Because of the similarity in task between ImageNet classification and galaxy cluster mass estimation (see \autoref{fig:imagenet_clusters}), I expect the ILSVRC successor's architectures (VGG\footnote{\citet{Simonyan_2015}} and ResNet\footnote{\citet{He_2016}}) to do well with our task. Therefore I want to examine their performances with our problem and compare it to a more recently developed model.
