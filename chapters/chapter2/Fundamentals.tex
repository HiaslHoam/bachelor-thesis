Before developing and training the neural network, I want to give a brief overview of the underlying fundamentals both in the astrophysics of galaxy clusters and the functioning of neural networks. These fundamentals can be found in many text books and are considered scientific consensus. The astronomical fundamentals are mainly based on \citet{Schneider2006} and \citet{Boehringer2010} and the fundamentals of deep neural networks are based on \citet{Goodfellow-et-al-2016} and \citet{aggarwal2018neural}.
