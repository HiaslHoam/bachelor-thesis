The seemingly easiest part of developing a neural network can be the most challenging. Instead of sitting in front of the screen, watching epochs after epochs train while the loss keeps on decreasing, one is often puzzled by bad performing networks, overfitting and many more issues. The fact that neural networks will not provide any hint in why they fail makes the training part maybe the most important and least straightforward step towards useful predictions. This chapter is supposed to explain my training pipeline and the hurdles I had to overcome.
