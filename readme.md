## Abstract

I examine three different deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to see if they are capable of estimating galaxy cluster masses from simulations made for eROSITA's Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS). Building up on a recent approach to infer these masses using a more simple CNN from Krippendorf et al. (2023), I study the differences in architecture, training and accuracy between the deep and the simple models. For that I firstly cover the basics of galaxy cluster X-ray emission and machine learning. Using the three architectures, I am able to get mass estimations that are close to the simple neural network. I provide a pipeline for training and testing more architectures, information on my training process and on how these models could be optimised in future attempts.
